# Concepts and Prototypes

* Concept shouldn't be too polished
* Concepts can explore metaphors
	1. Help users build a mental model
		* e.g. Computer desktop is like a physical desktop
	2. Is the metaphor good?
		* Does it help?
		* How well does it fit the problem?
		* Is it easy to represent?
		* Will the audience understand the metaphor?

* High fidelity prototype is essentially just a front end
