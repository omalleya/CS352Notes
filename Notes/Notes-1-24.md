4. Not getting low-level details.

    * Omitting details, one-word answers, filtering out everything but what you expected/wanted.

    * Accepting vague generalities:
        
        e.g.

          Q: "What do you usually buy at the grocery store?"

          A: "We usually buy fresh produce"

        Instead ask what they bought the last time they were at the grocery store. Be specific.

5. Not being honest abut user's reactions.

    * Users follow social conversational norms to be polite

6. Establishing the wrong relationship

    * Best thing to do is establish apprenticeship model.
    
      Our job is to learn how to do that task
    
    * Listen, learn, be humble, don't judge.
    * People usually do things for a reason.

# Human Capabilities

When we talk about perception we are talking about the senses (smell, touch, taste, hearing, seeing) as well as pain, temperature, balance, body position awareness.

Senses physically react to change -- Habituation

Perception can be thought of as an input device to the brain.

  * It is demand driven. Lazy, pulls in only what's needed.
  * It's expectation driven.
